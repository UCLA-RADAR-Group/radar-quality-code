A numeric code is used to indicate the quality of a size (effective diameter) estimate for radar-observed asteroids and comet nuclei.  The quality code parameter "Q" ranges from 0 (incorrect) to 4 (well-defined):

    Q = 0 → Result later proven incorrect
    Q = 1 → Result based on fragmentary, inconclusive, low-SNR, or low-resolution data.  Size may be completely wrong.
    Q = 2 → Result based on spectra with known spin rate and orientation or images with at least 10 detectable (SNR>3) pixels.  Size may be wrong by 30 percent.
    Q = 3 → Result based on basic (ellipsoid) shape model or extensive set of images/spectra.  Size may be wrong by 20 percent.
    Q = 4 → Result based on advanced shape model.  Secure result within the precision given.  

A size estimate based on limited bandwidth data with unknown spin rate and/or orientation is normally deemed inconclusive (Q=1).
A size estimate based on high-SNR images with limited orientational coverage is normally deemed of low (Q=2) to moderate (Q=3) quality depending on the apparent regularity of the object's shape.
In some cases, a trailing plus sign (+) or minus sign (-) is used to indicate a slightly better or worse quality than the unsigned value.
In some cases, a trailing question mark (?) is used to indicate an ambiguity in pole orientation that yields discrepant size estimates.   
The fractional uncertainty on volume is normally three times the fractional uncertainty on effective diameter.
